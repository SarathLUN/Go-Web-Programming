# Use packages

Modify our session code in "starting-code" to use these packages:

1. controllers
1. models
1. session

Refactor code as necessary to put code into appropriate packages.

# Solution

1. Create 3 directories:
```shell
mkdir controllers models session
```

2. Split the functions base on your concern, there is no absolute right for this.
After done just start the server.

```shell
go run main.go
```
